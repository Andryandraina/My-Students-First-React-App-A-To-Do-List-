 👩‍🏫 React To-Do App — A Classroom Project I Led
 
This little app is part of what I taught my students during a React session.  
We built it together to explore the basics: components, state, and interactivity. It was their **first real frontend project** — and a fun one! 🎉

## 💡 What We Covered
- React components & JSX
- useState for managing tasks
- Handling events (like adding & removing items)
- A touch of CSS for styling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML + CSS
